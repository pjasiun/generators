# ES6 generators samples

Samples to show how ECMAScript 6 generators and iterators works and can be used. Get them, run them, play with them, learn from them.

# Profits:

 - prevent other developers from changing your collection,
 - stop code execution,
 - simplication.

# Problems:

 - you can not iterate twice,
 - no map, filter, tools,
